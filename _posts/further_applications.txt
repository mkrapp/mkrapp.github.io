Title: More Applications

My numbers of applications grew to 5 last week.
And on Monday, I got my first job interview!
Only a few days after I've sent my application file.
I really enjoyed the interview, also because I felt quite comfortable with the people talking to me.
The discussion was vivid and the described tasks were very interesting (Let's keep our fingers crossed!).

Yesterday, I also had a meeting with the employment agency.
My supervisor there was open to my requests and wishes and I felt welcome which is not necessarily true.
Especially here in Germany.
As he explained, all employees at the agency are very, very busy, and they have to take care of as much as 300-400 customers.
That is a huge work load for them.

Now, I'm looking for new job ads, again.
