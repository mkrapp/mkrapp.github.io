I work for different projects. And it is not easy to keep track of the time
spent on these different projects. There are, of course, tools which handle time
tracking for you. But they are either for freelancers, too complicated, or
expensive. Here's an alternative: [`go-watch`](https://github.com/mkrapp/go-watch).

I've tried [`go`](https://golang.org) because the compiled executables can be
deployed everywhere. Try that, `Python`! In principle you would just need a
compiled version for your operating system but here's the clue: Try to install
it on your own:

All you need is a [`go` installation](https://golang.org/dl/) and a clone of the
`go-watch` project:

    git clone git://github.com/mkrapp/go-watch.git
