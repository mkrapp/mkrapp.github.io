I managed to be strict about reproducible science. And the paper (<a href="http://www.the-cryosphere-discuss.net/tc-2016-252/" target="blank_">*SEMIC: an efficient surface energy and mass balance model applied to the Greenland ice sheet*</a>) I was working on with my co-authors is the first example that reproducible science is fun and I will definitevly keep going in that direction. The paper did take much longer than I previously anticipated (at home it was colloquially dubbed *Rohrkrepierer*) but our Open-Science approach is not to blame.

So we can check one item of the previously mentioned bullet points: <a href="https://github.com/mkrapp/cookiecutter-reproducible-science" target="_blank">cookiecutter for reproducible science</a> serves a good purpose. Since then, literally *all* of my projects have started with this cookiecutter, even the smallest one. My project folder is now fully organized, each project has its `README.md` and I know where to look up for file. Some of my projects "in production" are easily converted into version-controlled projects by simply typing

```
git init .
```

I very much recommend it. Happy cookie cutting!
