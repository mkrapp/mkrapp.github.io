Title: To design a Website

I really have had to make up my mind to come up with a simple and sleek website.
It took me several days to think how my personal homepage should look like.
Although, nowadays, every institute's home page provides a staff list where (usually) every staff member is asked to upload some content&mdash;see [my personal PIK page](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/members/krapp), for example&mdash;but this kind of design and content is not what I was looking for.
And I love it simple!

So, I decided that my personal website should have a simple layout, at least the entry page.
Therefore, I chose to use tabs that, while popping up, show what the site is about.
It doesn't, by the way, as of now!
Who I am, showing a short CV, and showing what I'm interested in.
The main entry page should also link to this blog which it does right now.

So far, so good.
To allow some interactive behavior I included CSS overlays that pop up while clicking on the respective tab.
For a corporate website, I also use the same font _Josefin Slab_ and _EB Garamond_ which you can get from Google Fonts [here](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Josefin+Slab) and [here](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/EB+Garamond).
I like the style of that fonts; especially _Josefin Slab_ reminds me of the 20's or 30's.
And _EB Garamond_ is quite good to read as well.
