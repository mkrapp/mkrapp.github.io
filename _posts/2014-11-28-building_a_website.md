Hello everyone. This is my first posting on my blog where I want to provide some useful information about my job search.
I started of as a physicist ([TU-Berlin](http://www.physics.tu-berlin.de/home/parameter/en/)) about six years ago. Afterwards I went to Hamburg to do my graduate studies at the [Hamburg University](http://www.geo.uni-hamburg.de/en.html) and the [Max Planck Institute for Meteorology](http://www.mpimet.mpg.de/en/home.html). After finishing my Ph.D. I went back to Berlin to work at the [Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/pik-frontpage?set_language=en) as a postdoctoral researcher. My project about the melting of the Greenland Icesheet on different time scales ended two weeks ago. Now I'm taking my time to recollect what I've done so far and what I want to do next. This blog should help me and others to keep track about the expected and unexpected things to come, difficulties and the joy and pain of finding a new job outside of academia.

As of this week, I started writing a static blog engine in Python (_pystable_), which can be found on [Github](https:github.com/mkrapp/pystable) and cloned via

```
git clone https://github.com/mkrapp/pystable.git
```
Actually, this very web page is based on _pystable_.
