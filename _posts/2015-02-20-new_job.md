That one went fast.
And I hadn't seen that job coming, neither.
But I've now found a new job at an organisation supporting _Least Developed Countries_ and _Small Island Developing States_ in their efforts during climate negotiations.
Here's the [link](http://www.climateanalytics.org) to their website.
And here's the good thing about it: I can go there by bike!
That was (nearly) impossible at my former institute in Potsdam (though I did take the bike to get to and from the train station(s)).

For this reason, I had to change the title of this blog and I leave it open to new suggestions about what to write next.
I'm a little bit sad just having 8 blog entries.
Let me just think, maybe I come up with something great, next time...
