Title: Finish it

Finishing a project is tough. It takes a lot of time. Always more resources than
previously anticipated. And of course it is stressful, even briefly before the
deadline. And you really start to grasp the meaning of that word: "deadline".
There is no afterwards, there is no: Let's do it again! It is the one chance you
have been given and you need to take it.

And again, I learned quite a lot abut the last project (cannot tell you more
about its content because it's classified, but not in a military or conspiracy
sense ;) ). The most important thing again: **communication**. In many ways it
helps to discuss things over and over again.  Because there is no time to
clarify things afterwards. It doesn't really help to have the aha! moment right
after you submit your final report.

Communication is the essential thing for getting things done. It helps to start
over, re-think your approach and, of course, to avoid misconception. Because the
one simple thing is not necessarily the most obvious thing your counterpart.

The second most important thing: **specification**. Once you know what exactly
to do, it may be easier to follow specific guidelines or requirements. In the
best case, those specifications should not change. Specifications help to set
mile stones, which in turn help to meet required deadlines.

Last but not least: **revision**. And revisions take time. So don't start
revising your work to late.

The above suggestions do not guarantee a project to be successful but for me
they help to structure the project both in terms of time and in terms of
resources.
