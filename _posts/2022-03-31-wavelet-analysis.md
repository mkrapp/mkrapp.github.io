The interactive wavelet tool by Torrence & Compo from their "A Practical Guide to Wavelet Analysis" website was my go-to thing for running a wavelet analysis on my time series data for years.
It has been offline for quite some time now.
Anyway, here it is again, ready for your wavelet analysis:

Use `docker` to deploy and run locally:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build
```

It used to run on Heroku's free plan, which they have removed since then ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.

**Update**:

It's up and running again on [render.com](https://wavelet-analysis.onrender.com/)
