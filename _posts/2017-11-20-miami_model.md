I haven't been posting for a while as I now realise.
So here a new post about a fairly simple and/but old model to calculate the [*net primary productivity*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_production#Gross_primary_production_and_net_primary_production) (NPP), the so called *Miami Model*[^1]:

$$
\begin{aligned}
NPP(T) &= 3000/(1+\exp(1.315-0.119 T)) \\
NPP(P) &= 3000 (1-\exp(-0.000664 P)) \\
NPP &= \min(NPP(T),NPP(P))
\end{aligned}
$$


After reading through the more recent literature, it turns out that the Miami-Model is still regarded as useful proxy for annual NPP.
Global NPP observations are available, for example the [Terra/MODIS Net Primary Production Yearly L4 Global 1km](https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/dataset_discovery/modis/modis_products_table/mod17a3).
But these are currently not available as *global* data set.
Instead you can download all tiles (i.e., chunks of 1km by 1km tiles).
I have no idea why, but apparently, nobody is interested in compiling it from the available tile data.
Anyways, here is what the annual NPP looks like for a present-day climatology, i.e. the [Ten Minute Climatology](https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/hrg/tmc/).

As a `Python` function:
```python
import numpy as np
def miami_model(temp,prec,a=3000.,b=1.315,c=0.119,d=0.000664):
    npp_temp = a/(1.+np.exp(b-c*temp))
    npp_prec = a*(1.-np.exp(-d*prec))
    return np.fmin(npp_temp,npp_prec)
```
