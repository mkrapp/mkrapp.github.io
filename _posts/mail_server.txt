Title: To set up an email server

Today, I set up an email server on my _raspberrypi_.
Thanks to the [tutorial by Sam Hobbs](https://samhobbs.co.uk/raspberry-pi-email-server)!
And it works.
If you would like to give it a try, just drop me a [mail](mailto:mario@mariokrapp.com).

Here's what you need:

* [Postfix](http://www.postfix.org/documentation.html) as your mail transfer agent
* [Dovecot](http://www.dovecot.org) as your IMAP server
* A (trusted) certificate for encryption (SSL and the like)

In principle, you could also add a spam filter and things like that.
I skipped that for this reason.
Because my domain has no static IP address ([Dynamic DNS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_DNS)), sent mails are often regarded as spam.
Hence, this is just an exercise in server administration.

As an add-on I also installed [Roundcube](http://roundcube.net) as web-mail application.
