Happy new year, everyone. The last post was quite a while ago.
Therefore, my new year's resolution is to add posts on a regular basis.
Just in case someone is reading all this<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup>.
Good luck to everybody. More interesting things and an update about my job search coming soon.

_Update (2015/01/05)_:

I already submitted three applications (For privacy reasons I won't tell to whom the applications went).
I'm still struggling for the right search terms when looking up the job search websites like stepstone, greenjobs, etc.
I think it has to do with myself struggling to nail down my skills and to focus on what is important to me, at least for a new engagement.
However, instead of me giving a detailed description of what I would like to do next, I broaden search patterns, instead and seek through the much more general results.

Not counting the days between Christmas and New Year's Eve, about 20-30 new job offers hit my mailbox.
If one or 2 of these hits match my idea for a new job or even better show me a new idea, my goals is fulfilled.
Next:

* Prepare a motivation letter!
* Apply!
* Wait for response!

The latter being the worst part, though I really like the first two steps!
